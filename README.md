# Bank Network
### 1st IAED Project - 14'15

### Problem Description

A recent financial crisis demonstrated the need to understand the way financial
systems are interconnected.  One way of doing it is map a financial system onto
a network, where each node (or vertex) represents a bank and a(n oriented)
connection between two nodes represents a loan.

This representation enables the analysis of a financial interactions network's
robustness, for example, facing one of its intervenient's collapse.

In this project, we aim to develop a `C` program that can register and
manipulate information referring to the appearance and disappearance of
connections between banks, providing a basis for the development of more complex
analysis tools.
